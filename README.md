## To Contributors

Note that we use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) for all our style needs.

Please note that `master` is only for stable releases. All development work should be done on `dev`. If you are working on your own thing, please append your GitHub username when you branch so we know what branch belongs to who. For example: `dev-wildandrewlee`. Feature branches should look something like `dev-new-ui`. In most cases, it is prefered to use the feature branch naming style vs the username style.

Merged branches will be deleted every 2-3 days after merging.
